# Project Euler

My solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

I started these in 2011 when I should have been studying for my university final exams. I originally used MATLAB to solve them but later switched to Python. I don't seem to have my old files, but perhaps I'll do the problems again one day.
